## About Me  
I am a recent BSIT graduate from FEU Institute of Technology with a specialization in Animation and Game Development. While my academic background includes programming and multimedia, I am now focused on pursuing a career in System Administration.

I am highly adaptable and open to learning new technologies, including different operating systems, cloud platforms, and automation tools. I welcome the opportunity to be trained and mentored in a professional environment.
